Network Topology Icons
======================

A collection of network topology icons released under the `Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license.<https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/>`_  I'm not a particularly good graphic designer but it was hard to find a set of icons in SVG format with everything I needed, so I figured I might as well try to create them.
